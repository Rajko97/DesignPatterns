# Design Patterns

A repository for demonstrating design patterns implemented in Kotlin programming language.

## Creational
These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

* [Factory](https://github.com/Rajko97/DesignPatterns/tree/factory)
* [Builder](https://github.com/Rajko97/DesignPatterns/tree/builder)

## Behavioral design patterns
These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.
* [Observer](https://github.com/Rajko97/DesignPatterns/tree/observer)

## Structural design patterns
These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.
